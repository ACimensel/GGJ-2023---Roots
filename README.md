# GGJ-2023---Roots

UpRooted is a 2 player, top-down, 2.5D game, where you play as neighbors in your own backyard trying to destroy each others gardens. Players throw their bad roots and corrupt the other players garden. This is our submission for the 48hr Global Game Jam 2023, with the theme of "Roots".
